Here's how you can peek at the storyline from a story card.\r\n\r\n## Step-by-Step Guide\r\n\r\n1. **Navigate to the Story Card**: First, find the story you are interested in. You can do this by browsing through the available stories on our platform.\r\n\r\n2. **Locate the Clock Icon**: On the story card, look for the clock icon which looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n   <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2.5\" class=\"w-6 h-6 mr-2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n     <circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"12\" r=\"10\"></circle>\r\n     <path d=\"M12 6v6l4 2\"></path>\r\n   </svg>\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Hover Over the Icon**: Move your cursor over the clock icon. When you hover over it, a pop-up will appear.\r\n\r\n4. **View the Storyline**: The pop-up will provide a brief overview or 'peek' of the storyline. This allows you to quickly understand the gist of the story without reading the entire content.\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n\r\n- The storyline peek is designed to give you a quick summary. For the full story, click on the story card to read more.\r\n- If the pop-up does not appear, make sure your cursor is directly over the clock icon.\r\n\r\nEnjoy exploring stories in a more efficient way!",
