## **Guide to Using Advanced Article Search**

Welcome to our advanced search feature! This powerful tool allows you to quickly find articles in our database by searching through various fields like the title, content, category, and tags. Whether you're looking for specific information or just browsing, our search feature makes it easy to find what you need.

### **How to Perform a Search**

   - You will find a search bar at the top of the page.

2. **Entering Your Search Terms:**
   - Type your search query into the search bar.
   - You can search for terms within the article's title, content, its category, or tags associated with it.
   - Example search queries:
     - "Getting Started": This will find articles with "Getting Started" in the title or content.
     - "Settings": This will find articles categorized under "Settings" or mention "Settings" in their content.

3. **Using Multiple Terms:**
   - You can combine different terms in a single query.

4. **Refining Your Search:**

   - Click on an article title to read the full content.

### **Tips for Effective Searching**

- **Be Specific:** Narrow down your search with specific terms.
